\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

Many of the recent successes of deep reinforcement learning have been in
single agent domains, where an agent's reward depends only on its own actions.
However, several important and interesting problems in communication, robotics
and gaming involve interactions between multiple agents. In multi-agent
environments, agents should ideally learn to predict the actions of other
agents while also taking into account their own actions. Unfortunately, traditional
reinforcement learning approaches such as deep Q-learning struggle to learn in
these environments, as they have each agent learn an independently optimal
function. For our course project, we propose employing a new algorithm called
MADDPG~\cite{lowe2017multi} for centralized multi-agent learning in various
tasks involving cooperation.
Specific examples of tasks which we hope to investigate in order of importance:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item coordinating traffic signals
  \item covert communication
  \item communication over noisy channel
\end{enumerate}

We also plan to investigate certain optimizations in training such as evolutionary strategies, which have been shown to be competitive in training to traditional methods with increased parallelism \cite{salimans2017evolution}.
If these methods prove successful, they can be incorporated with other training methods to increase learning scalability.
