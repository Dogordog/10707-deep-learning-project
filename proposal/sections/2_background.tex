\section{Background}
\subsection{Evolutionary Algorithms}
Evolutionary algorithms are randomized algorithm which search through a parameter space using operations such as random mutation and mixing of parameter combinations~\cite{man1996genetic}.
These sort of algorithms are embarrassingly parallel and can be applied to optimize reinforcement learning parameters.
This sort of approach, which treats the reinforcement learning problem as a black box, has been used to scale a Mujoco Humanoid problem to 1440 cores~\cite{salimans2017evolution}.

The idea of using these algorithms for RL is that the simplicity of brute force trumps the complexity of other optimizers.
Evolutionary algorithms have low communication overhead, no backpropagation calculations, high parallelism and an optimization algorithm free of stability issues, and they do this while being competitive in training progress~\cite{salimans2017evolution}.
Some of the earliest RNNs were trained with random search, where they surpassed backpropagation methods, so this trend has been seen before in the ML community~\cite{hochreiter1997long}.
