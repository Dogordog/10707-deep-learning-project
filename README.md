Deep Learning Course Project

This repository contains our implementation of DQN, DDPG, and MADDPG that works on a slightly modified version of the predator-pray environment. The code for our models are contained in the multiagent-particle-envs/ folder. The modified environment is in multiagent-particle-envs/multiagent/scenarios/ folder. Our results, including trained weights and training rewards and losses are contained in the results/ folder.
